    abstract = "{In biomedicine, every molecular measurement is relative to a reference point, like a fixed aliquot of RNA extracted from a tissue, a defined number of blood cells, or a defined volume of biofluid. Reference points are often chosen for practical reasons. For example, we might want to assess the metabolome of a diseased organ but can only measure metabolites in blood or urine. In this case, the observable data only indirectly reflects the disease state. The statistical implications of these discrepancies in reference points have not yet been discussed.Here, we show that reference point discrepancies compromise the performance of regression models like the LASSO. As an alternative, we suggest zero-sum regression for a reference point insensitive analysis. We show that zero-sum regression is superior to the LASSO in case of a poor choice of reference point both in simulations and in an application that integrates intestinal microbiome analysis with metabolomics. Moreover, we describe a novel coordinate descent based algorithm to fit zero-sum elastic nets.The R-package “zeroSum” can be downloaded at https://github.com/rehbergT/zeroSum. Moreover, we provide all R-scripts and data used to produce the results of this manuscript as Supplementary Material.Supplementary material is available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = {Summary
    Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of blood cancer and is characterized by a striking degree of genetic and clinical heterogeneity. This heterogeneity poses a major barrier to understanding the genetic basis of the disease and its response to therapy. Here, we performed an integrative analysis of whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing in a cohort of 1,001 DLBCL patients to comprehensively define the landscape of 150 genetic drivers of the disease. We characterized the functional impact of these genes using an unbiased CRISPR screen of DLBCL cell lines to define oncogenes that promote cell growth. A prognostic model comprising these genetic alterations outperformed current established methods: cell of origin, the International Prognostic Index comprising clinical variables, and dual MYC and BCL2 expression. These results comprehensively define the genetic drivers and their functional roles in DLBCL to identify new therapeutic opportunities in the disease.}

	abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a disease with heterogeneous outcome. Stromal signatures have been correlated to survival in DLBCL. Their use, however, is hampered by the lack of assays for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material (FFPE). We constructed a lymphoma-associated macrophage interaction signature (LAMIS) interrogating features of the microenvironment using a NanoString assay applicable to FFPE. The clinical impact of the signature could be validated in a cohort of 466 patients enrolled in prospective clinical trials of the German High-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group (DSHNHL). Patients with high expression of the signature (LAMIShigh) had shorter EFS, PFS, and OS. Multivariate analyses revealed independence from IPI factors in EFS (HR 1.7, 95{\%} CI 1.2--2.4, p-value = 0.001), PFS (HR 1.8, 95{\%} CI 1.2--2.5, p-value = 0.001) and OS (HR 1.8, 95{\%} CI 1.3--2.7, p-value = 0.001). Multivariate analyses adjusted for the IPI factors showed the signature to be independent from COO, MYC rearrangements and double expresser status (DE). LAMIShigh and simultaneous DE status characterized a patient subgroup with dismal prognosis and early relapse. Our data underline the importance of the microenvironment in prognosis. Combined analysis of stromal features, the IPI and DE may provide a new rationale for targeted therapy.},

Still it is challenging to apply them to data generated by different protocols or technical platforms.We analyzed paired data for the same tumors (Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and features that had been generated by different experimental protocols and analytical platforms including the nanoString nCounter and Affymetrix Gene Chip transcriptomics as well as the SWATH and SRM proteomics platforms. A statistical model that assumes independent sample and feature effects accounted for 69–94\\% of technical variability. We analyzed how variability is propagated through linear signatures possibly affecting predictions and treatment recommendations. Linear signatures with feature weights adding to zero were substantially more robust than unbalanced signatures. They yielded consistent predictions across data from different platforms, both for transcriptomics and proteomics data. Similarly stable were their predictions across data from fresh frozen and matching formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tumor tissue.The R-package ‘zeroSum’ can be downloaded at https://github.com/rehbergT/zeroSum.

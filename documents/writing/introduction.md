# To beat: the IPI

## [International prognostic index (IPI) for non-Hodgkins lymphoma patients](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199309303291402)

It incorporates 

- age (≤ 60 vs. >60 years), 
- tumor stage (stage I or II [localized disease] vs. stage III or IV [advanced disease]), 
- the number of extranodal sites of disease (≤ 1 vs. >1), 
- performance status (0 or 1 vs. ≥ 2), 
- and serum LDH level (≤ 1 times normal vs. >1 times normal)

as features.

"These five features were used to design a model to predict an individual patient's risk of death -- the international index. Since the relative risks associated with each of the independently significant risk factors were comparable (Table 3), the relative risk of death could be characterized by summing the number of risk factors present at diagnosis. Risk groups were defined by comparing the relative risk of death in patients with each possible number of presenting risk factors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) and combining categories with similar relative risks (e.g., 0 with 1 or 4 with 5). Patients were then assigned to one of four risk groups on the basis of their number of presenting risk factors: 0 or 1, low risk; 2, low intermediate risk; 3, high intermediate risk; or 4 or 5, high risk."

## [Revised International Prognostic Index (R-IPI)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497120419056?via%3Dihub)

Assign the above stages 0-5 into the three groups

- very good (0),
- good (1, 2) and
- poor (3, 4, 5).

For DLBCL treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy, this gives three well separated groups for survival analyis (progression-free survival and overall survival).

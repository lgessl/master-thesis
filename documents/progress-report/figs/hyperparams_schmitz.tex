        model family & Cox, logistic regression. \\
        input data & Gene expression only; gene expression with early integrated IPI: 
            as one continuous variable ("with ipi cont") or five binary variables ("with disc ipi feat"). \\ 
        zero-sum weights & $u = 0$; $u_i = 1$ for gene-expression features, 
            else $u_i = 1$ ("zerosum"). \\
        LASSO weights & Standardization, i.e., $v_i$ is the standard deviation of feature $i$ ("std"); 
            $v_i = 1$ for gene-expression features, else $0$. \\
        sample weights & $w = \mathbf{1}/n$. \\
        $T$ & $1, 1.25, 1.5, \ldots, 2.5$; additionally $\infty$ for Cox. \\

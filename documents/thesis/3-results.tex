\chapter{Results} \label{chap:results}

In this triune chapter, we start with introducing three DLBCL data sets that include 
survival and gene expression features. Next, we split every of these three data sets into 
a train and test cohort, fit models for a variety of hyperparameter tuples in $H$ to the training 
cohort, validate them and test the best on the test cohort; this is less about presenting a 
high-performing model, but more about analyzing validated and tested errors to make $H$ slimmer and 
better for the future. This future plays out in the last part as we train and validate on one of 
the three data sets and test on another and deal with cross-platform variability.

\section{The data}

Our data sets are taken from papers by Schmitz et al. \cite{schmitz18}, Reddy et al. \cite{reddy17}
and Staiger et al. \cite{staiger20}; see Table \ref{table:data} for key properties and comparison.

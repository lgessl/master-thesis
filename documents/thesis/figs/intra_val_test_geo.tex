    \caption{Validation versus test error in intra-trial experiments for models only predicting 
        from gene expression levels for all 
        three data sets in the rows. The left and right column show the same points, but highlight 
        different groupings of the models. The elastic-net regularization strengt $\lambda$, the 
        training survival cutoff $T$ and $n_\text{combi}$ have already been tuned.}

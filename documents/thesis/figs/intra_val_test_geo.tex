    \caption{Validation versus test error in intra-trial experiments for models only predicting 
        from gene expression levels for all 
        three data sets in the rows. The left and right column show the same points, but highlight 
        different groupings of the models. The dashed gray line is the 
        identity line. The training survival cutoff $T$, 
        $n_\text{combi}$, elastic-net regularization strength $\lambda$ (for GLMs), 
        $m$ and $n_\text{min}$ (for RFs) have already been optimized with respect to the 
        validation error. The 
        validation error of the $\text{tIPI}$ is in fact also a test error on independent data, 
        namely our training cohort.}

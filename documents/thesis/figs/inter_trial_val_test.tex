    \caption{Validation versus test error in inter-trial experiments. The dashed gray line is the 
        identity line. The training survival cutoff $T$, 
        $n_\text{combi}$, elastic-net regularization strength $\lambda$ (for GLMs), 
        $B$, $m$ and $n_\text{min}$ (for RFs) have already been optimized with respect to the 
        validation error. The validation error for the $\text{tIPI}$ is in 
        fact also a test error on independent data, namely our training cohort.}

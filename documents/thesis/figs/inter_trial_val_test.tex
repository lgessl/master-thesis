    \caption{Validation versus test error in inter-trial experiments. The dashed gray line is the 
        identity line. The elastic-net regularization strength $\lambda$, training survival cutoff 
        $T$, $n_\text{combi}$ and the random-forest hyperparameters $B$, $m$ and $n_\text{combi}$ 
        have already been tuned. The validation error for the $\text{tIPI}$ is in fact also a test 
        error on independent data, namely our train cohort.}

    \caption{Validation versus test error in intra-trial experiments for all candidate models on 
        all three data sets in the rows. The dashed 
        gray line is the identity line. The notation 
        $c_1$-$c_2$ encodes a model of class $c_1$ as the early model $f_1$ nested into a model of 
        class $c_2$ as the late model $f$ according to Alg. \ref{alg:nested-pcv}.
        ``GE'' is an acronym for gene expression and refers to the presence of all available 
        gene-expression levels in the predictor, while ``no GE'' refers to the absence of all of 
        them. Both columns show 
        the same points, but highlight different groupings. The training survival cutoff $T$, 
        $n_\text{combi}$, elastic-net regularization strength $\lambda$ (for GLMs), 
        $B$, $m$ and $n_\text{min}$ (for RFs) have already been optimized with respect to the 
        validation error. }
